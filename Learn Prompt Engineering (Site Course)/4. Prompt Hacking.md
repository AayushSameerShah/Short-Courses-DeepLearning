# Types of **Prompt Hacking**

ðŸ‘€ We will cover three types of prompt hacking:

1. Prompt injection
2. Prompt leaking
3. Jailbreaking

## `1.` Prompt Injection

> Prompt Injection is the process of overriding original instructions in the prompt with **special user input**. It often occurs **when untrusted input is used as part** of the prompt.
