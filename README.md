# 🩳 Short-Courses

Hey yo! 🙋🏻‍♂️

Things are lookin' good? This **repository contains** the notes that I have organized and taken by taking the short courses from various platforms — that can be from multiple sources including *deepleaning.org, youtube, udemy* or just some book.

## 🔑 How to access them?

Well, that's fairly simple. All courses are seperate and are contained in their respective directories. The directories may contain one or multiple files *(mostly one though)* which will act like a cheat-sheet of that course.

## ✨ Yeah, the format...

Have tried my best to keep things consistant and eye-soothing (👀) but, pardon my dust.
