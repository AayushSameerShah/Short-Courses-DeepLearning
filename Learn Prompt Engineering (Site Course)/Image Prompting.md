# Not much to discuss... so just the points

1. Do multiple iterations, until perfect ðŸŒŸ
2. Give the **styles**. Like style of `Christopher nolan`, `Rendered in unity`, `Tinted in red` etc.
3. Be specific, describe - `Made of glass`.
4. ðŸ”¥ Use the quality boosters - `Amazing`, `Good Quality`, 
    - **ðŸš€ Some good quality boosters**
      - `majestic, incredible pyramid, 4K`
      - `High resolution, 2K, 4K, 8K, clear, good lighting`
      - `detailed, extremely detailed, sharp focus, intricate`
      - `beautiful, realistic+++, complementary colors, high quality`
      - `hyper detailed, masterpiece, best quality, artstation, stunning`

5. Use the "word weights" so that you can give the **emphasis** on the important words.
    - `mountain | tree:-10`
    - Since we weighted tree very negatively, they do not appear in the generated image.
    - `A planet in space:10 | bursting with color red, blue, and purple:4 | aliens:-10 | 4K, high quality`
    etc.

6. Fix **Deformed Generations**: Here we can `fix` the fingers, weird face and so on.
